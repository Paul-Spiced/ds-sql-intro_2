You are assisting a vet clinic in making sense of their data. Their data is in two tables. And they need you tu perform the following analytics:

1. How many pets, how many owners?
2. what are the most and least common petnames?
3. what kind of pets do we have?
4. what is the gender balance across pets and species?
5. what is the average age of the pets?
6. how many owners have more than one pet?
7. do the owners that have more than one pet have the same kind of pet.
8. do poeple name their pets like poeple?
9. Extract the information of petnames and owners side-by-side!
10. what are the cities with the largest amount of pets?

## Let's look at some of the procedures those pets had.

1. match procedures to prescriptions!
2. what pets did't get rabies vaccination?
3. what is the most prevalent type of surgery?
4. how much did owners spend on their pets?
5. look at the data and ask yourself what more questions one could ask!
