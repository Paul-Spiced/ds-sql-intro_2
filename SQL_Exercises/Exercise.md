How you will find the thief

When you follow the tutorial you will step-by-step:

-> Find out, who was in Paris at that time.

-> The thief was probably not working alone. Is there any suspicious communication during the time in question?

-> If you find the people responsible, who was the actual wire-puller and who was "only" the henchman?


In dBeaver set the monalisa as the default schema.
